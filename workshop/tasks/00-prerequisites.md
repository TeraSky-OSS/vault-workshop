- **[Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Flinux%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download)**: A tool to run Kubernetes clusters locally. You will need this to set up a local Kubernetes environment for the workshop.
- **[Vault CLI](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/1.16.3/vault_1.16.3_linux_amd64.zip)**: The Vault CLI (Version 1.16.3) to interact with Vault instances and perform various tasks during the workshop.
- **[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/#install-kubectl-binary-with-curl-on-linux)**: The Kubectl CLI installed on your local machine to interact with the minikube.
- **[Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-script)**: The Helm 3.x CLI installed on your local machine.

Make sure both Minikube and Vault CLI are installed and configured on your machine before proceeding.
