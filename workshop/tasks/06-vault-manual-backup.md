# Vault Workshop - Vault Manual Snapshot

In this section, we will create a manual snapshot of the Vault data, simulate a data loss by deleting Vaultâ€™s data in Minikube, and then restore the snapshot to recover the Vault data.

---

### **Step 1: Create a Manual Snapshot**

1. **Create a snapshot**:
   Use the `vault operator raft snapshot save` command to create a snapshot of the Vault data.
   ```bash
   vault operator raft snapshot save vault-data.snap
   ```

2. **Verify the snapshot**:
   Check that the snapshot file has been created.
   ```bash
   ll vault-data.snap
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Simulate Data Loss**

1. **Identify the Vault data directory in Minikube**:
   Vault stores its data in a persistent volume. Find the volume using:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pvc -n vault
   ```

2. **Delete the Vault data**:
   Delete the persistent volume and persistent volume claim to simulate data loss.
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pvc -n vault <vault-pvc-name>
   kubectl delete pv <vault-pv-name>
   ```

3. **Restart the Vault pod**:
   Restart the Vault pod to confirm that the data is no longer available.
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod -n vault vault-0
   kubectl get pods -n vault
   ```

   When the pod restarts, Vault will not function correctly due to missing data.

### **Step 3: Restore the Snapshot**

1. **Recreate the persistent volume and claim**:
   Recreate the storage for Vault. You can use the same YAML configuration used during the initial setup or let the Helm chart manage it:
   ```bash
   helm upgrade -i vault hashicorp/vault --namespace vault
   ```

2. **Restore the snapshot**:
   Use the snapshot file created earlier to restore the Vault data.
   ```bash
   vault operator raft snapshot restore vault-data.snap
   ```

3. **Verify the restoration**:
   Check that the data has been restored and Vault is operational.
   ```bash
   vault status
   ```

   > **Note**: Inspect all the changes we made along the workshop and see that everything exists.

4. **Unseal Vault**:
   ```bash
   vault operator unseal $VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY
   ```

---

### **Conclusion**

In this section, we successfully created a manual snapshot of the Vault data, simulated a data loss by deleting the Vault data in kubernetes, and restored the Vault using the snapshot. This process ensures that you can recover your Vault data in case of unexpected failures.
